!*****************ZONE EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATION*********************
!Zone Heating and Cooling Equipment are attached to zones by the following statements:

ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,
       !extensible:4 Duplicate the four fields Zone Equipment Object Type through Heating Priority
       !List equipment in simulation order. Note that an ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit or
       !AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object must be listed in this statement if there is a forced
       !air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       !Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       !Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       !For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       !serve that type of load. For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       !limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       !For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS should be
       !assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1. Any other equipment should be assigned
       !sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added to the zone.

!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! setpoint each timestep.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

        !schedule with the actual real time prices entered in the schedule.
   A11, !Customer Baseline Load Schedule Name
        !Used with real time pricing rates. The name of a schedule that contains the baseline

        !When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but 
        !when the baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the 
        !electric demand charge is used. The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet 
        !object. This allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
   A4,  !Adjustment Source Variable
        !The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the 
        !baseline source variable. The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the 
        !values from the adjustment source variable. If left blank the adjustment source variable is the 		!same as the baseline source variable.

        !ratchet only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in 
        !the Season To selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.
   A7,  !Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        !Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month 
        !demand". For this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier. This value maybe 
        !left blank if no multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.
   A8;  !Offset Value or Variable Name
        !A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this 
        !case an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the 
        !offset value to be negative representing that the demand be reduced. If no value is entered it is 
        !assumed to be zero and not affect the ratchet.

       !  is a sum variable. If the variable is an average variable it reports the average value.
       ! This is probably the most common Aggregation Type option to choose.
       !Maximum and Minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it
       ! along with the time that it first occurred. When Maximum or Minimum are selected a
       ! column is automatically shown in the output report for the time that it occurred.
       !When Maximum or Minimum are used with an average variable the value is divided
       ! by the length of the timestep.
       !ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum
       ! and displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.
       ! Order of the variables in the report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.
       ! This can be used when an outdoor temperature should be reported for the time of the
       !  maximum cooling load.
       !HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero
       !  and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       !HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this
       !  variable has a zero value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour
       !  that a fan does not operate.
       !HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !  this variable has a positive value. Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !  that this variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a
       !  zero value are all included.
       !HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !  this variable has a negative value. Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !  that this variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and
       !  hours with a zero value are all included.
       !SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when
       !  during the hours that the previous variable displayed with any of the Aggregation Types
       !  starting with "Hours". For "sum" type variables adds up the values for each timestep
       !  and reports the sum of the value monthly during the hours reported on the previous
       !  variable. For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the average for the month
       !  during the hours reported on the previous variable. Order of the variables in
       !  the report is important when using this Aggregation Type.
       !MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value
       !  occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !  When the Maximum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !  by the length of the timestep. Order of the variables in the report is important
       !  when using this Aggregation Type.
       !MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value
       !  occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !  When the Minimum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !  by the length of the timestep. Order of the variables in the report is important
       !  when using this Aggregation Type.
