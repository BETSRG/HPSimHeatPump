        !Water and control temperatures for heating work together to provide
        !a linear function that determines the water temperature sent to the
        !radiant system.  The current control temperature (see Temperature Control Type above) is
        !compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time.
        !If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the
        !inlet water temperature is set to the low water temperature.  If the
        !control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet
        !water temperature is set to the high water temperature.  If the control
        !temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet water
        !temperature is linearly interpolated between the low and high water temperature values.

!Zone Heating and Cooling Equipment are attached to zones by the following statements:

ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,
       !extensible:4 Duplicate the four fields Zone Equipment Object Type through Heating Priority
       !List equipment in simulation order.  Note that an ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit or
       !AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object must be listed in this statement if there is a forced
       !air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       !Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       !Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       !For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       !serve that type of load.  For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       !limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       !For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS
       !should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1.  Any other equipment should
       !be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added
       !to the zone.

!group Controllers
!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! setpoint each timestep.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

  A13, !Heating Capacity Function of Cooling Capacity Curve Name
       !The curve represents how the heating capacity of the chiller varies with cooling
       !capacity when the chiller is simultaeous heating and cooling.  The curve is normalized
       !so an input of 1.0 represents the nominal cooling capacity and an output of 1.0
       !represents the full heating capacity (see the Heating to cooling capacity ratio input)
       !The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
  A14, !Fuel Input to Heat Output Ratio During Heating Only Operation Curve Name
       !When the chiller is operating as only a heater, this curve is used to represent the
       !fraction of fuel used as the heating load varies.  It is normalized so that a value
       !of 1.0 is the full heating capacity.  The curve is usually linear or quadratic and
       !will probably be similar to a boiler curve for most chillers.

        !note difference between the baseline use and the actual use.
   A12, !field Group Name
        !note The group name of the tariff such as distribution transmission supplier etc. If more than one tariff
        !note with the same group name is present and qualifies only the lowest cost tariff is used. Usually the group

   N1;  !field Number of Months
        !minimum 1
        !maximum 12
        !note A number from 1 to 12.  If no value entered 12 is assumed when the qualify type is minimum and 1 when
        !note the qualify type is maximum.  This is the number of months that the threshold test applies to determine
        !note if the rate qualifies or not.  If the season is less than 12 months (if it is not annual) then the
        !note value is automatically reduced to the number of months of the seaon.

       !key MinimumDuringHoursShown
       !note The method of aggregation for the selected variable or meter.
       !note SumOrAverage adds up the values for every timestep in the month if the variable
       !note   is a sum variable. If the variable is an average variable it reports the average value.
       !note   This is probably the most common Aggregation Type option to choose.
       !note Maximum and Minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it
       !note   along with the time that it first occurred.  When Maximum or Minimum are selected a
       !note   column is automatically shown in the output report for the time that it occurred.
       !note   When Maximum or Minimum are used with an average variable the value is divided
       !note   by the length of the timestep.
       !note ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum
       !note   and displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.
       !note   Order of the variables in the report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.
       !note   This can be used when an outdoor temperature should be reported for the time of the
       !note   maximum cooling load.
       !note HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero
       !note   and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       !note HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this
       !note   variable has a zero value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour
       !note   that a fan does not operate.
       !note HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !note   this variable has a positive value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !note HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !note   that this variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a
       !note   zero value are all included.
       !note HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !note   this variable has a negative value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !note HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !note   that this variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and
       !note   hours with a zero value are all included.
       !note SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when
       !note   during the hours that the previous variable displayed with any of the Aggregation Types
       !note   starting with "Hours". For "sum" type variables adds up the values for each timestep
       !note   and reports the sum of the value monthly during the hours reported on the previous
       !note   variable. For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the average for the month
       !note   during the hours reported on the previous variable.  Order of the variables in
       !note   the report is important when using this Aggregation Type.
       !note MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value
       !note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !note   When the Maximum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       !note   when using this Aggregation Type.
       !note MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value
       !note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !note   When the Minimum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       !note   when using this Aggregation Type.
